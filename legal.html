					<h2>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW IT IS USED</h2>
					<p>
						When you access the website, you may provide certain personally
						identifiable information including but not limited to your name,
						email address, phone number, address, avatar image, credit card
						information when you make a purchase on the website. This
						information is collected when you register on the site, place an

						process your requests or transactions, tailor advertisements to you,
						elicit reviews of services or products, provide you offers,
						promotions and to follow up with you through correspondence (email,
						live chat, or phone). We may also use this information to provide
						you offers and promotions from our partners and/or our affiliates in
						exchange for a commission without additional cost to you.
						Additionally, like other websites, this website automatically
						collects certain information about you through Log Data and Google
						Analytics. Log Data is information about your computer’s Internet

						related to user behavior and interests, improve our performance and
						your use of the website and to further enhance our products and
						services offered to you.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<h2>COMMENTS AND SOCIAL MEDIA</h2>
					<p>
						If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained
						indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up
						comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation
						queue. When you leave a comment, your name, email address, and
						website/organization name are not shared with a third party, and may
						be used to communicate with you. Social media accounts and sharing
						options are available on this website. Social media sites (Facebook,
						Twitter, YouTube, and so forth) can track your personal information.
						Should you choose to interact with us on social media, please note
						that you will be voluntarily disclosing that personal information.

						and can be collected and used by others. We have no control over and
						take no responsibility for the use, storage or dissemination of such
						publicly disclosed personal information by you. Any such
						interactions via comments and social media with us do not subject us
						to any kind of liability related to the misuse of your information
						by others.
